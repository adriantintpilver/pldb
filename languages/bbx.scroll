paragraph
 In 1985, BASIS released their first generation of Business BASIC to extend the functionality of Business BASIC and aptly named it BBxÂ® (Business BASIC eXtended). Successive generations of BASIS technology continue to enhance the Business BASIC language. A fifth generation product delivers BASIS' first GUI deployment, followed by the sixth generation that introduces modern graphical application development tools for Business BASIC. Coupling these tools with a powerful database management system enable developers to create comprehensive and tightly integrated business applications that are reliable, scalable, cost-effective, and platform independent.
